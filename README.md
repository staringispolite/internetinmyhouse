What are my options for internet in my house? 

# Initial thoughts
* Landing page that lets you input your address & verify via some service. Surprisingly, even this part sucks on every ISP website I've found
* Collect answers from as many ISPs as are known in the area. Server-side scraping if need be. Client-side scraping if possible.
* Prob don't need to even cache results except locally. Won't be many repeats so not worth it at first
* Alt: requests go into a job queue. Give email to get results.
* Revenue from ads on the site related to moving or internet signup deals. Same in emails.
